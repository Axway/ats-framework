<h1><strong>What is ATS?</strong></h1>
<p>The Axway Test System (ATS) is an internally developed testing framework widely used for the testing needs of most of the Axway products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>What are the key features of ATS?</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>Easy to write and maintain automated tests. Understandable by both QA and developers</li>
<li>Appropriate for variety types of functional and performance testing</li>
<li>Separate components, or complete products, or products grouped as a bigger product can be tested</li>
<li>Tests work on all platforms with (virtually) no change</li>
<li>Support of distributed environments &ndash; it all works locally and remotely</li>
<li>Comprehensive statistics about the system resource usage of the tested applications</li>
<li>Consolidated reporting allowing easy test result analyzes</li>
<li>Ability to freely mix ATS code with your own code</li>
<li>Ability to plug in your own code, so it feels like it is part of ATS. For example you can use your own file transfer protocol or database</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>What kind of testing it is good at?</strong></h1>
<p>If we following the naming conventions at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing</a> we can say that ATS falls in the following categories:</p>
<h3>Testing levels</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integration testing</li>
<li>Component interface testing</li>
<li>System testing<br /> Obviously Unit testing is not a strong point and it should never be</li></ul>
<h3>Testing types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Installation testing</li>
<li>Smoke and sanity testing</li>
<li>Regression testing</li>
<li>Functional testing</li>
<li>Performance testing(Load and Endurance)</li></ul>
<h3>Testing processes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Agile or Extreme development model</li>
<li>Waterfall development model</li>
<li>Top-down and bottom-up</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>What can you do with ATS?</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately we cannot give both a short and detailed enough answer to this question ;)</li>
<li>Testing a software application involves interacting with that application and the environment it is living in. Some examples of such interactions are the following:</li>
<li>File transfer over most popular protocols. You can also plug in support for your own protocol</li>
<li>All kinds of actions on a file system</li>
<li>Interactions with databases</li>
<li>HTTP and REST operations. Good support for JSON and XML data</li>
<li>Running external processes and analyzing the produced result</li>
<li>Manipulating and sending complex mails</li>
<li>Interacting with application through a standard UI(HTML, Mobile, Swing)</li>
<li>Run your own test steps on a remote host</li>
<li>Run your own test steps according to some load pattern to achieve the wanted load on the tested application. Monitor its performance meanwhile</li></ul>
