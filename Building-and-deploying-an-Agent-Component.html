                    <p>You have created your Agent component here</p><p>Now it is time to build it.</p><p> </p><hr/><h1 id="BuildinganddeployinganAgentComponent-Building">Building</h1><p>In Java world it is easiest to have class and other resources packaged into jar files.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro has-no-icon confluence-information-macro-note"><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Currently we use Maven for all ATS projects, but there is one piece left that still needs to be done by ANT.</p><p>This piece is the code building your Agent components.</p><p>We will update this documentation when make this part running on Maven as well.</p></div></div><p>So for now you need to copy this ANT build file the root project folder.</p><p><br/> You may want to change the name of the project in this <em>build.xml</em> file. This is the second line. You should also check the static parameters placed at the beginning of the file. Please take a look at them and the comments next to them.</p><p>Then run the build.xml file file using ANT.</p><p>If everything goes as OK a few seconds later you will see a new folder <em>target</em> and in its <em>dist</em> sub-folder there will be two jar files.</p><p>You can go ahead and open those two jar files, see their content. You will see that:</p><h3 id="BuildinganddeployinganAgentComponent-Theproducedserversidejar">The produced server side jar</h3><p>We call it a server-side jar because it will operate on the side of the Agent. Its name ends with <em>-autoserver.jar</em> because this is how we set it by the build script.</p><p>It has the <em>agent_descriptor.xml</em> in its root as well as all <em>action classes</em> and their <em>source files</em></p><h3 id="BuildinganddeployinganAgentComponent-Theproducedclientsidejar">The produced client side jar</h3><p> </p><p>We call it a client-side jar because it will operate on the side of the Test Executor. Its name ends with <em>-autoclient.jar</em> because this is how we set it by the build script.</p><p>It also contains classes with same names as the ones in the server side jar, but if you open them you will be surprised by their content.</p><p>This classes have same names, their methods have same names and input arguments as the server-side ones, but there body is very different.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro has-no-icon confluence-information-macro-note"><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>All classes in the client side jar are generated by the build procedure and they only contain instructions for the Agent so it knows how to execute the server side classes.</p><p>But you do not really need to bother with them.</p></div></div><p> </p><hr/><h1 id="BuildinganddeployinganAgentComponent-Deploying">Deploying</h1><h3 id="BuildinganddeployinganAgentComponent-Theclientsidejar">The client side jar</h3><p>This one must be present in the classpath of the Test Executor. From that point on you can use them in your test code</p><h3 id="BuildinganddeployinganAgentComponent-Theserversidejar">The server side jar</h3><p>This one must be placed in the <em> <strong>ats-agent\actions</strong> </em> subfolder of your ATS Agent distribution.</p><p>Even a fresh Agent will have some such components already available - these are the ones ATS uses internally to do something on the host the Agent is working on.</p><p>In case your actions depend on some other third party classes, you must place their jars in the <em> <strong>ats-agent\actions_dependencies</strong> </em> subfolder of your ATS Agent distribution.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro has-no-icon confluence-information-macro-note"><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>You do not have to restart the Agent in case of replacing your component jar as the <em> <strong>ats-agent\actions</strong> </em> subfolder is constantly monitored and the changes will be picked up in a few seconds.</p><p>But you will need to restart the Agent when placing jars in the <em> <strong>ats-agent\actions_dependencies</strong> </em> subfolder</p></div></div><div class="confluence-information-macro has-no-icon confluence-information-macro-note"><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>The Agent log file (placed in <em> <strong>logs</strong> </em> subfolder) will tell you when your component is found and will list the loaded action class names</p></div></div><p> </p><hr/><p>Proceed with running your actions in some performance test</p><p>Back to <a href="Creating-ATS-actions.html">parent page</a></p><hr/>
