		<h2>What is JIP?</h2>
		JIP is a code profiling tool much like the <code>hprof</code> tool
		that ships with the JDK. There are, however, a few differences:
		<ol>
			<li><b>Interactivity.</b> <code>hprof</code> is not an interactive
			profiler. It starts when your program starts and ends when the 
			JVM exits. In many cases this doesn't give you a true 
			measure of performance since the Just In Time compiler doesn't
			compile code on the first pass. In addition, this type of profiler
			is not useable at all in web applications since you end up
			profiling the web container as well as the web application.
			JIP, on the other hand, allows you to turn the profiler
			on and off while the JVM is running.</li>
			
			<li><b>No native code.</b> Most profilers have some native 
			component. This is because most profilers use the 
			<code>JVMPI</code> (Java Virtual Machine Profiling Interface) 
			which requires the use of native components. JIP, however, 
			is pure Java. It takes advantage of the Java5&#153; feature
			which allows you to hook the classloader. JIP adds <a 
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_oriented">
			aspects</a> to every method of every class that you want
			to profile. These aspects allow it to capture performance
			data.</li>
			
			<li><b>Very low overhead.</b>
			Most profilers are very slow. In many cases <code>hprof</code>
			will cause a program to run 20 times slower. JIP, on the other
			hand, is lightweight. A VM with profiling turned on is about
			twice as slow as one without a profiler. When the profiler
			is turned off, there is almost no overhead associated with
			using JIP.</li>
			
			<li><b>Performance Timings.</b>
			JIP gathers performance data. You cannot use most profilers
			to do timings of your application. <code>hprof</code>, for
			example, will show you the relative amount of time that is 
			spent in different parts of your code, but <code>hprof</code>
			has so much overhead, that you cannot use it to get real
			world timing measurements. JIP, on the other hand, actually
			tracks the amount of time used to gather performance data
			and factors that time out of its analysis. This allows you
			to get close to real world timings for every class in your 
			code. So there is no need to litter your code with 
			<code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code>!</li>
			
			<li><b>Filters by package/class name.</b> One of the annoying
			things about hprof is that there is no way to filter out classes
			by class or package name. JIP allows you to do just that (for more
			information, look at the profile.properties file). This in not to
			say that the execution time is not included. It is included
			but can only be seen in the execution time of the calling 
			routine.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>How to use JIP</h2>
		<br>
		Note: JIP requires a Java5&#153 VM.
		</br>
		<P>
			To run the profiler, you need the following:
			<ul>
				<li><code>profile.jar</code></li>
				<li>A <a href="profile-properties.html">profile properties</a> file (optional)</li>
			</ul>
		</P>
		<p> These files are loaded by the application classloader and
		    should not be in the extentions loader path. The jar files
			need to be in the same directory. The properties file can
			be anywhere.
		</p>
		<p>
			To use the profiler, you need to use the following JVM arguments:
			<pre><code>
-javaagent:[DIR]\profile.jar -Dprofile.properties=[DIR2]\profile.properties
			</code></pre>
			where [DIR] is the directory that contains the profile.jar
			<br>
			<blockquote>
			<I>Note: Due to a bug in the JDK on OS X,</I> [DIR]
			<i>must be a fully qualifed path.</i>
			</blockquote>	
			and [DIR2] is the directory that contains the profile.properties
		</p>
		<p>
			By default (if you don't give a <code>-Dprofile.properties</code>),
			profiling starts out turned on and the remote 
			interface (use to profile interactively) is turned off (see
			the <code>profile.properies</code> for more information). In 
			this case JIP works just like <code>hprof</code>, although it is
			much faster.
		</p>
		<p>
			When using with stock Tomcat, set the java agent by using the 
			env. variable <code>JAVA_OPTS</code>. For example, on Windows&#153
			use the following:
<pre><code>SET JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:[DIR]\profile.jar -Dprofile.properties=[DIR2]\profile.properties</code></pre>			
			Where [DIR1] and [DIR2] are described as above.
		</p>
		<a name="interactive"/>
		<h3>Interactive profiling</h3>		
		<p>
			In some cases, like webapps, you probably want to start out with
			the profiler turned off. When you get to some case you want to 
			test, you'd like to turn it on, run the test case, turn the
			profiler off and dump the results. To do these things, you
			first of all need to change the profile properties file:
			<pre><code>
profiler=off
remote=on
port=15599
			</code></pre>
			To interact with the profiler you need the <code>client.jar</code> which is
			in the <code>/client</code> directory of the JIP distribution.
			<ul>
				<li>Specify the file to dump to profile data to:
<pre><code>File.bat localhost 15599 c:\tmp\test-profile.txt</code></pre>
				</li>
				<li>To turn the profiler on:
<pre><code>Start.bat localhost 15599</code></pre>
				</li>
				<li>Now you'd run your test case. When you're done,
					you can dump the profile data with:
<pre><code>Finish.bat localhost 15599</code></pre>
				</li>
			</ul>
			In my personal experience with webapps, you should exercise a
			test case at least six times before trying to measure performance.
			Presumably this is because the Just In Time compiler will observe
			how the code is used a number of times before compiling it into
			native code.
		</p>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		There are some examples of how to use JIP: <code>example.bat</code>, 
		<code>example-ant-1.5.sh</code> and <code>example.sh</code>. All use the
		example of compiling JIP with ant. <code>example.bat</code> and 
		<code>example-ant-1.5.sh</code> work only with ant 1.5 and <code>example.sh</code>
		works only with ant 1.6 (this is because the way that ant gets invoked
		changed between the two releases).

		<a name="2"/>
		<h4>Wow, JIP is pretty fast. How can it be faster that other profilers?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		JIP's speed is mainly due to the fact that it doesn't profile every class. JIP doesn't
		profile classes that are in the bootstrap classpath (all of the core Java classes) or 
		classes that are in the extension classpath (i.e., files in <code>-Djava.ext.dirs=</code>).
		These are classes that you can't change, so it's not every useful to know what their
		performace is like. It's usually enough to know that a method that is calling one
		of these classes is slow. You can usually figure out how to optimize things from there.
		<br/>

		<a name="23"/>
		<h4>Where can I get more information about the mechanism that JIP uses?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		This IBM DeveloperWorks <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jip/">article</a>
		gives an overview of the mechanisms that JIP uses.
		</blockquote>
		
		<a name="22"/>
		<h4>Am I supposed to put <code>profile.jar</code> in my classpath, my extensions classpath,
			my bootstrap classpath, or someother classpath?</h4>		
		<blockquote>
		It is best not to put <code>profile.jar</code> in any of these places. The classes in this JAR are loaded
		by the application classloader (the classloader that loads classes that are in the classpath), but
		they don't needed to be in the classpath itself.
		</blockquote>
		
		<a name="20"/>
		<h4>JIP's output is missing all of the classes that are part of the JDK, what gives?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		JIP doesn't profile classes that are loaded by the bootstrap or extensions classloaders. This
		is one of the reasons that it is so fast. On a technical level, the classes in JIP are loaded
		by the javaagent which uses the application classloader. This means that while JIP is capable
		of instrumenting classes loaded by all classloaders, the instrumentation itself is composed 
		of calls to classes in the JIP package, which are loaded by the application classloader, which
		aren't visible to classes loaded by the bootstrap and extensions classloaders. For more on this
		look <a href="classloader.html">here</a>.
		</blockquote>
		
		<a name="3"/>
		<h4>How can I control which classes and packages JIP profiles?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		There are two mechanisms to control which classes and packages JIP profiles. The main one is
		by using <code>ClassLoaderFilters</code>. A <code>ClassLoaderFilter</code> tells JIP to profile
		classes based on which classloader was used to load them. Why is this necessary? To start with,
		JIP cannot profile classes loaded by the Bootstrap or Extensions classloaders. Also, which 
		classloader your application uses can vary by environment. For example,
		standalone applications use the Application classloader. You can see which class this is by 
		calling <code>ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()</code> (usually <code>sun.misc.Launcher$AppClasLoader
		</code>). But if you're running in a container like Tomcat or JBoss, the application classloder
		is used to load the container's classes. The container will use another classloader to load
		application classes. Since you usually don't want to see all of what is going on inside Tomcat
		or JBoss, you can use a <code>ClassLoaderFilter</code> to tell JIP to instrument just your classes.
		<p/>
		There are several prebuild <code>ClassLoaderFilters</code> that can be used:
		<ul>
			<li><code>com.mentorgen.tools.profile.instrument.clfilter.StandardClassLoaderFilter</code></li>
			<li><code>com.mentorgen.tools.profile.instrument.clfilter.WebAppClassLoaderFilter</code></li>
			<li><code>com.mentorgen.tools.profile.instrument.clfilter.AntTaskClassLoaderFilter</code></li>
			<li><code>net.sourceforge.jiprof.instrument.clfilter.JBossEJBClassLoaderFilter</code></li>
			<li><code>net.sourceforge.jiprof.instrument.clfilter.JBossServletClassLoaderFilter</code></li>
			<li><code>net.sourceforge.jiprof.instrument.clfilter.JBossUniversalClassLoaderFilter</code></li>
		</ul>
		You specify which class loader filter you want to use via the profile properties file:
<pre><code>
ClassLoaderFilter.1=com.mentorgen.tools.profile.instrument.clfilter.StandardClassLoaderFilter
</code></pre>		
		Writing your own is as simple as implementing the <code>com.mentorgen.tools.profile.instrument.clfilter.ClassLoaderFilter
		</code> interface. To do that, you'll need to find out which classloader is loading your code, which can  
		be easily accomplished by adding this somewhere in your code:
<pre><code>
System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getClass().getName());
</code></pre>
		If you create a <code>ClassLoaderFilter</code> if an enviroment that it's supported, please create a
		<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=148701&atid=772418">feature request</a> 
		for it and attach your BSD licensed code. It will be greatfully included in the next release!
		<p/>
		There is a simpler method for doing this that doesn't involve writting any code. The 
		<code>GenericClassLoaderFilter</code> allows you to specify when Class Loaders to filter on
		in the profile properties file. To do this, first change your class loader filter:
<pre><code>
ClassLoaderFilter.1=net.sourceforge.jiprof.instrument.clfilter.GenericClassLoaderFilter
</code></pre>
		(If you don't specify a class loader filter, JIP defaults to <code>GenericClassLoaderFilter</code>,
		so you could just as easily remove that property from the file).
		</br>
		Once you know which
		classloader(s) you want to use, put them in the profile properties file:
<pre><code>
accept-class-loaders=org.apache.catalina.loader.StandardClassLoader,org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader
</code></pre>
		If the classloader(s) your interested in implements an interface, you can specify that instead (in other
		words, the classes you specify don't need to be subclasses of <code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code>). In
		the example above, both Tomcat classloaders implement a common interface, so you could do this:
<pre><code>
accept-class-loaders=org.apache.catalina.loader.Reloader
</code></pre>
		<p/><a name="includeexclude"/>
		There is an additional mechansim that provides a finer level of control over which classes are 
		profiled and which aren't. 
		This is done via include and exclude lists. A list is a comma sperated 
		list of packages or fully qualified class names. For example:
<pre><code>
exlude=com.sun.tools.javac,org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLScanner
</code></pre>
		This will exclude from the profile all classes and packages in the <code>com.sun.tools.javac</code>
		package. In addition, the class <code>org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLScanner</code> will be excluded
		as well.
		<br/>
		Include lists work the same way, only they tell the profiler what classes can be included. 
		Note that the lists are applied to the classes that the <code>ClassLoaderFilter</code>
		accepts. So it further narrows what is profiled. Note also that if you use both an include and
		an exclude list, the include list is applied first. Be very careful when using both include and
		exclude. If a method that you want to see is called from a class that has been excluded, you
		will not see the call at all! Include lists are very tricky in this regard because they
		implicitly exclude classes and packages.
		</blockquote>
		
		<a name="25"/>
		<h4>How do I specify the output file name?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		Specify <code>file=[name]</code> in the profile properties file. The default is <code>profile.txt</code>
		which will be output in the JVM's working directory. You can even specify what type of output you'd 
		like using the <code>output</code> property. This defaults to <code>text</code> but you can
		set if to <a href="#14"><code>xml</code></a> or <code>both</code>. If you specify both, JIP will
		substitute &quot;xml&quot; as the extension for the file name of the xml file. In other words, if you say
<code><pre>
file=profile.txt
output=both
</pre></code>
		you'll get two output files, <code>profile.txt</code> and <code>profile.xml</code>.
		</blockquote>
		
		<a name="4"/>
		<h4>I've run JIP several times on my application and each time I get a different set
			of timings. Shouldn't they always be the same?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		In a multiuser environment, even the performance of staticly compiled languages can vary.
		Java uses a runtime &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">Just 
		In Time</a>&quot; compiler that observes how the code
		is being executed in order to use an optimal compilation strategy. This can lead to a variance
		in the time it takes a short running program to execute. Other factors such and disk and network
		IO can also contribute to the amount of time it takes a program to execute. These kinds of factors
		should be easy to spot in JIP's output.
		</p>
		You should be aware that there are two things that JIP doesn't measure:
		<ol>
			<li>The execution of static initializers. JIP uses an internal call stack to measure
			the net execution time of methods. Static initializers aren't executed as part of a program's
			flow of control, but rather are executed when the JVM loads the class, so JIP doesn't measure 
			them.</li>
			<li>JMV startup time and time the JVM spends loading classes.</li>
		</ol>
		</blockquote>
		
		<a name="5"/>
		<h4>When I exclude more classes/packages, JIP reports that the application is running
			faster. Why is that?
		</h4>
		<blockquote>
		When you tell JIP to exclude a class or package, no instrumentation is done to those classes.
		Less profiling means lower overhead which makes everything
		run faster. While JIP does make an attempt to factor out its own overhead when taking measurements,
		nothing is perfect.

		<h4>How can I profile interactively (after all, it is called the Java <i>Interactive</i> 
			Profiler)?
		</h4>
		<blockquote>
		Information on interactive profiling can be found <a href="#interactive">here</a>.
		</blockquote>
		
		<a name="7"/>
		<h4>I'm running JIP, but I don't get any output.
		</h4>
		<blockquote>
		First, make sure that JIP is actually running. If it is, you should see this output when the
		JVM starts:
<pre><code>
Java Interactive Profiler: starting
</code></pre>
		If you don't see this, make sure that the JVM is being <a href="#use">invoked correctly</a>.
		<p/>
		If you can see that in the output, make sure that you're using the right 
		<a href="#3"><code>ClassLoaderFilter</code></a> and/or 
		<code>accept-class-loaders</code>. Then look at what you're <a href="#includeexclude">including 
		and excluding</a> and make sure it makes sense. If all of this looks good, add the following to
		your profile properties file:
<pre><code>
debug=on
</code></pre>
		Then try to profile again. When the program starts up, you should see a bunch of messages in <code>stdout</code> 
		that look like this:

		<h4>In the output I see something called an Interaction #. What is that?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		The way that JIP profiles is by tracking call stacks. Each call stack is associated with a thread. 
		There are circumstances under which you end up with more than one call stack associated with a 
		given thread. This often happens in web apps where worker threads are pooled and reused 
		across mutliple client requests. JIP calls these interactions. You also might start a profile
		in the middle of a thread executing. Once the flow of control makes it back to the place
		where it started, profiling must stop. Every time this happens, it's called an interaction.
		</blockquote>
		
		<a name="21"/>
		<h4>I'm trying to profile the Extension class loader, but I'm getting a runtime exception.</h4>
		<blockquote>
		You cannot profile classes that are loaded by the Extension classloader. When JIP instruments
		a class, it inserts a call to the runtime profiler. The runtime profiler class itself is loaded
		by the javaagent interface using the Application classloader. Extensions loaded classes cannot 
		&quot;see&quot; classes loaded by the Application classloader. If you're trying to profile a 
		standalone app and want to profile a class that's being loaded by the extensions classloader
		(i.e., <code>-Djava.ext.dirs=[some-dir-with-my-jar]</code>), move the jar file

		You can do this with profile properties. Setting <code>max-method-count</code> to any 
		positive integer will expressly limit the number of entries in this section of the output.
		-1 is the default, which means no limit. Setting this to <code>compact</code> will only
		display methods with a gross execution time of 10 (milliseconds) or more. You can control

		<h4>The call trees in JIP's output can get pretty deep. Is there anyway I can

		<blockquote>
		There are a number of ways to do this, all of which use profile properties. The first is
		<code>thread-depth</code> which defaults to -1, which means no limit. Setting this to a
		positive integer will limit how deep the call tree is. If you set this property to <code>
		compact</code>, JIP will use a node's gross time to determine if it should be displayed.

		<h4>Is there a way to use JIP to do heap analysis?</h4>

		<h4>Is there an easy to use JIP's output to do my own analysis?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		JIP has an output option for outputting an XML document (<code>output=xml</code>).

		custom analysis. In fact, someone created a GUI front-end for JIP that uses the XML
		output. It's <a href="#15">pretty cool</a>.

		<h4>Does JIP have a GUI front end?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		Yes! It's called <code>jipViewer</code> and can be found in the <code>profile</code> directory.
		It requires that when you profile your app, you generate an XML file output (<code>output=xml</code>
		or <code>output=both</code>).

		<h4>Can I hook into JIP's instrumentation to collect my own runtime metrics?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		Yes! JIP allows you to plug in your own runtime profiler. Here's how to do it:
		<ol>
			<li>Create a class with the following methods (no need to implement an interface,
			nothing to inherit from -- total fredom!):
<pre><code>
public static void initProfiler()
public static void start(String className, String methodName)
public static void end(String className, String methodName)
public static void alloc(String className)
public static void beginWait(String className, String methodName)
public static void endWait(String className, String methodName)
public static void unwind(String className, String methodName, String exception)
</code></pre>
			(<code>beginWait</code> and <code>endWait</code> are called when an object is
			waiting on a semaphore.) You might want to also add a 
			<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread)">shutdownHook</a>
			so that your class will get notified when the JVM shutsdown.
			</li>
			<li>In your profile properties file, change <code>profiler-class</code>
			to point to your class.</li>
		</ol>
			JIP comes with 2 profilers. <code>com.mentorgen.tools.profile.runtime.Profile</code>
			is the one that's normally used. <code>net.sourceforge.jiprof.timeline.TimeLineProfiler</code>
			isn't really a profiler at all -- it's a tool to aid in the understanding of concurrency issues.
		</blockquote>

		<h4>I'm having issues related to concurrency in my application, can I use JIP to
			give me a timeline of which methods are being called in different threads?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		Yes! Change you profile properties to have the following:
<pre><code>
profiler-class=net.sourceforge.jiprof.timeline.TimeLineProfiler
</code></pre>
		The output looks like this:
<pre><code>

</code></pre>
			Ledgend:		
				<br/><b>Time</b> - This is the time, relative to the start of profiling, when the events listed were captured.
				<br/><b>START</b> - The given method was entered.
				<br/><b>END</b> - The given method was exited.
				<br/><b>W:START</b> - The given method started to wait on a mutex.
				<br/><b>W:END</b> - The given method ended its wait on a mutex.				
				<br/><b>ALLOC</b> - An instance of the given class was created.
				<br/><b>THROWS</b> - An exception was thrown.
				<br/><b>[<i>x</i>]</b> - This is the id of the thread associated with the event.
				<p/>
				Notes on usage:<p/>
				- <b><code>output-method-signatures</code></b> can be used to display the full method signature.
				<br/>- <b><code>clock-resolution</b></code> can be used to toggle the unit of time used to generate
				the timeline. You can use either <code><b>ms</b></code> for milliseconds or <code><b>ns</b></code>  for
				nanoseconds. (Note that this property is <b>not</b> used by the standard profiler).
				<br/>- As with the standard JIP profiler, tracking object allocations can be turned on or off by using
				<code><b>track.object.alloc=on|off</b></code>. 
				<br/>- Currently, the Timeline profiler only supports one output format, so the <code><b>output</b></code>
				property is ignored.
				<br/>- You cannot use both the standard profiler and the timeline profiler at the same time.
				<br/>- Output from the Timeline profiler can be very, very large.
				<br/>- Currently, the interactive profiling is not supported.
				<br/>- The ordering of method calls is correct within the context of a thread. Ordering is not guaranteed
				between threads.

		Nope. JIP has no way to monitor what's happing in the heap.

		<h4>I'm trying to profile an application interactively, but it's hard to start and 
			stop the profiler at just the right time. Is there a way to explicitly tell JIP 
			when to start and stop profiling?</h4>
		<blockquote>
		If you're using the standard profiler, you can manipulate it programatically at runtime with the
		following static calls:
<pre><code>
Profile.clear(); // initialises the profiler
Profile.start(); // starts the profiler
Profile.stop();  // stops the profiler
Profile.setFileName(String fileName); // changes the output file name
Profile.shutdown(); // shuts the profiler down.
</code></pre>

		<code>Profile.shutdown()</code> causes JIP to generate output. It's recommended that you call
		this right after calling <code>Profile.stop();</code>. You could also add a 
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread)">shutdownHook</a>
		that calls <code>Profile.shutdown()</code>. Note also that when doing explicit profiling, you should
		probably start the VM with <code>profiler=off</code> in your profile properties.
