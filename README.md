**WORK IN PROGRESS - Initial testing is OK, but still more need to be done.**
**Will be replacing master branch when done.**

**Note that 4.0.8 and 4.0.9 will be the only two releases that use log4j2. Future releases will be exclusively log4j1 (as all the pre 4.0.8 releases)**

  <li>Easy to write and maintain automated tests. Understandable by both QA and developers</li>
  <li>Appropriate for variety types of functional and performance testing</li>
  <li>Separate components, or complete products, or products grouped as a bigger product can be tested</li>
  <li>Tests work on all platforms with (virtually) no change</li>
  <li>Support of distributed environments â€“ it all works locally and remotely</li>
  <li>Comprehensive statistics about the system resource usage of the tested applications</li>
  <li>Consolidated reporting allowing easy test result analyzes</li>
  <li>Ability to freely mix ATS code with your own code</li>
  <li>Ability to plug in your own code, so it feels like it is part of ATS. For example you can use your own file transfer protocol or database</li>
  <li>Some functionalities can also be used by non-java projects</li>
</ul>
