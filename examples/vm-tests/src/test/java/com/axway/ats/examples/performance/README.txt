Natural order of understanding the performance tests:
	The tests are getting from simpler to more complex. 
	It is good to read the tests in same class one by one as they get more complex and stuff explained in 
	first test is not explained again in the next test. Only the new stuff is explained in the next test.
	
Here is the recommended way of trying the performance tests classes:
	SimpleRemoteTests
	DifferentLoadPatternTests
	ParametrizationTests
	OtherOptionsTests
