                    <h1 id="Testlogging-Introduction">Introduction</h1><hr/><p>Good test reporting is crucial for serious automation testing. You need an easy way to:</p><ul><li>Check which tests passed, which failed and why</li><li>Analyze the performance of the tested application</li><li>Compare the results of running same of different tests</li></ul><p>Here we discuss different features of the ATS logging system</p><hr/><h1 id="Testlogging-Flexibleoutput">Flexible output</h1><p>Here is where all logs can go</p><ul><li>Test Explorer database<br/>this is a persisted database storage, the results are reviewed by Test Explorer web application TODO: provide link</li><li>Console<br/>good when reviewing the results of one or few tests</li><li>Mail report</li><li><p>custom</p></li></ul><p>All log outputs are optional. You can use just one of them or some of them as you wish.</p><h1 id="Testlogging-Basedonlog4j">Based on log4j</h1><p>The ATS logging system is configured through <a class="external-link" href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/" rel="nofollow">log4j</a></p><p>Log4j is very flexible in terms of defining how much logging you need by specifying its log level. It is also possible to have more logs from some classes or some packages and less from others.</p><h1 class="with-breadcrumbs" id="Testlogging-ConfigureATSDatabaseLogging">Configure ATS Database Logging</h1><p><a href="Configure-ATS-Database-Logging_119482677.html">Here</a> are the steps to make it working for you.</p><h1 id="Testlogging-Realtime,butnonblockingthetestexecution">Real time, but non blocking the test execution</h1><p>The logging is performed in real time. This means while your tests are running, you can look up the results in Test Explorer.</p><p>The test execution itself is not blocked waiting for the log event to be persisted in the database. The reason is that each log event is placed into a queue so the test execution can go on. While the test is running an additional dedicated thread moves these cached events to the database.</p><p>If you have very heavy logging, it may turn out it will take some time (some number of seconds) until the log event makes it to the database. So we have to say that <em>real time</em> does not mean exactly <em>immediately</em></p><h1 id="Testlogging-Everyparticipatingpartycanlogintosametestcase">Every participating party can log into same testcase</h1><p>Each java application located anywhere on the test environment can be configured to send its log4j events into the same test case. This means for example that while doing some work with your Application Under Test(AUT), you can have log event from the java API of the AUT into the same testcase.</p><p>Here is who can log:</p><ul><li>The QA from the test</li><li>ATS libraries used in your tests</li><li>Actions running on some ATS agent</li><li>The Application Under Test</li><li>Third party libraries</li></ul><h1 id="Testlogging-TestExploreruserguide">Test Explorer user guide</h1><hr/><p>Test Explorer is a web application used to review the test results.
